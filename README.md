## Overview

We recently embarked on a journey to learn Rust with the aim of developing tools and applications specifically for the Rust developer community.

This our first project is a simple number-based guessing game. This project serves as a foundational exercise to help us create and refine the necessary
tools and processes for writing, testing, building, and publishing Rust crates.

By leveraging GitHub Actions, we intend to automate these steps, achieving a seamless workflow similar to what we currently use for Docker Containers,
Python Packages, and RubyGems. This initiative will enable us to extend our automated development and deployment capabilities to the Rust ecosystem,
ensuring consistency and efficiency across our projects.

It is also a fun silly little game to play :)

## Installation

```
cargo install guessing-game
```

## To Play
